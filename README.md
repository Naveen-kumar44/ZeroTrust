Zero Trust

# Introduction
As organizations continue to face cybersecurity threats, the need for robust security measures has become more pressing than ever. That's why I've been working on a small project exploring the concept of Zero Trust and its potential applications.

My Zero Trust PDF covers the basics of the Zero Trust model, how it differs from traditional security models, and some best practices for implementing it within an organization. Whether you're an IT professional, a business owner, or simply interested in cybersecurity, I believe this resource will be useful for you.

Feel free to download the PDF and share it with your colleagues and network. Let's work together to create a more secure digital world! ðŸ”’ðŸ’»
